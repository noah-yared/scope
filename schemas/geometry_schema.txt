Input:
- algorithm: <algorithm_name>                # "segments_intersect", "graham_scan", "jarvis_march"
- x: [...]                                   # list of x coordinates
- y: [...]                                   # list of y coordinates
- example_output: ...                        # optional reference output

Step 1: Preprocessing
- Form point list P = [(x[i], y[i]) for i in range(n)]
- For "segments_intersect":
    Identify endpoints of the two segments from P
- For "graham_scan" and "jarvis_march":
    Identify anchor point (lowest y, tie by lowest x)

Step 2: Select geometry procedure
- segments_intersect:
    Use orientation tests and bounding box checks to determine intersection
- graham_scan:
    Sort points by polar angle with respect to anchor
    Maintain stack or list for hull construction using left turn tests
- jarvis_march:
    Initialize hull with anchor
    Repeatedly choose the most counterclockwise point relative to the last hull point

Step 3: Iterate through elements
- segments_intersect:
    Evaluate orient(a, b, c) for required combinations
- graham_scan:
    For each sorted point:
        While hull has at least two points and last turn is not left:
            Pop last point from hull
        Add current point to hull
- jarvis_march:
    Loop:
        From current hull vertex, search all points to find next hull point
        Append to hull until anchor is reached

Step 4: Final output
- segments_intersect:
    Output 1 if segments intersect, else 0
- graham_scan:
    Output a binary array of length n marking hull vertices with 1
- jarvis_march:
    Output a binary array of length n marking hull vertices with 1

Output:
{
    "answer": ...          # integer for intersection, binary list for hull algorithms
}
